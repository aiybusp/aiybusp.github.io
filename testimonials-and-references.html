      "When Ariel and I worked together, we were a very strong team. I was very impressed at how much of a hardworking person she is! She always made customers feel comfortable. She is a quick learner and always eager to learn new skills and techniques that will help her improve her customer service. When she puts her mind to something she won't give up till it's accomplished!"
