Hello and welcome! I'm a biotech student with a strong passion for chemistry and microbiology. Born and raised in Azusa, CA, my journey in the realm of science was largely influenced by my family's connection to microbiology.

## My Journey
After finishing high school, I started my academic journey at Rio Hondo College before making the decision to transfer to Pasadena City College. Along the way, I've had the privilege of taking part in the prestigious NASA Summer Internship program, which further solidified my interest in the biotech sector. The guidance of mentors that played an instrumental role in shaping my academic aspirations. Their unwavering support, combined with my fervent interest in biotech subjects like chemistry and microbiology, has been the backbone of my academic accomplishments.

## Achievements
I've been honored to receive recognitions such as the Presidential Academic Award and the Good Citizenship Award. These accolades, while deeply appreciated, only tell part of my story. Behind the scenes, I've faced and overcome significant personal challenges, molding me into the resilient individual I am today.

## Personal Interests
Outside of my professional interests, I'm an avid reader and cherish quality time with my family. One of my more unique hobbies includes coaching junior varsity golf at my alma mater. Life as a student is all about balance; tools like iCal and Good Notes have been invaluable in helping me juggle school, work, and personal commitments.

## Looking Ahead
My aspirations are clear: I aim to complete my biotech degree and embark on a fulfilling career in the private sector. With organizations like NASA or Livermore Lab on my dream list, I'm committed to exploring roles in biotech and microbiology engineering.

## This Website
Designed as an extension of my professional persona, this website aims to expand my network, showcase my projects, and potentially serve as a platform for sharing knowledge. I see a bright future for this space, evolving to include more content and insights in the form of a blog.

## My Values
Guiding my every step are core values of transparency, resourcefulness, and simplicity. In the world of biotech, principles such as Respect for Life, Social Responsibility, Accountability, and Sustainability resonate deeply with me. These values not only define my professional outlook but also shape my personal interactions.
