## Summary
A 28-year-old patient presented to the ER with heartburn, worsening abdominal pain, and melena. Daily ibuprofen use for chronic shoulder pain was the only medication history. Initial and peer-supported reasoning pointed toward peptic ulcer disease (PUD) with upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, most likely gastric or duodenal in origin.

### Initial Diagnosis & Reasoning (Ari Perkins)
**Primary Diagnosis:** Peptic Ulcer Disease (likely gastric or duodenal)  
**Likely Structures Involved:** Stomach or proximal duodenum  
**Rationale:**
- **NSAID Use:** Daily ibuprofen inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 → reduced prostaglandin synthesis → decreased mucosal protection → increased ulcer risk.
- **Melena:** Strongly indicates upper GI bleeding from ulceration.
- **Lack of Other Comorbidities:** Supports a drug-induced etiology.
- **Next Steps:** Upper endoscopy (EGD) for visualization, H. pylori testing.

---

### Peer Discussion Highlights
- **Consensus Diagnosis:** The majority of peers agreed with PUD + upper GI bleed due to chronic NSAID use.
- **Alternative Differentials Raised:** Gastritis, esophagitis, or GERD.
- **Common Management Points:** Discontinue NSAIDs, initiate PPI therapy, perform EGD, and test for H. pylori.

### Final Conclusion (Ari Perkins)
After peer review, I maintained my initial diagnosis: **Peptic Ulcer Disease with Upper GI Bleed**.  
If the patient had presented with **red blood in the stool** (hematochezia) instead of melena, my differential would expand to include **lower GI sources** such as hemorrhoids, diverticulosis, colorectal cancer, or inflammatory bowel disease.  
**Additional Workup in that Scenario:** Colonoscopy in addition to upper endoscopy.
