*__Alumni Coach__: July 2022-January 2025*

After graduating, I voulenteered for my alma maters girls junior varsity golf team. I stepped in to coach and guide the girls when the head coach was unable to make it to practoce or matches. I provided constructive feedback tailored to each member individually due to the strong bonds and trust that I formed when playing alongside them as their teammate. I would lead practice, oversee matches, and promote team cohesion through bonding activities. I also ensured to provide comfortable and clear communication between the head coach and the team members. 
My commitment to the team extended beyond the greens as I provided unwavering support to my team in their personal and professional growth. I had a dedication to fostering their self-confidence which reflected when the team turned the season around one season to another from being a defeated to undefeated team. 
Although my time as a coach has ended with my girls all graduated, I am proud of the bonds Ive made and the small part I was honored to play in their development. I will continue my role as a Alumni Coach for any future junior varsity team as I was immensely proud.

*__Parent/Family Voulenteer__: March 2020-May 2024*

In my role, I successfully spearheaded the design and implementation of signage for numerous events, which included the annual student fundraiser, the annual gala auction, the yearbook production, and various monthly celebrations with an educational focus. My responsibilities extended beyond the creative aspect to logistical coordination, including acknowledging donors. I managed to categorize these benefactors based on their contribution levels and preference for anonymity or recognition under their personal or business names.
To accomplish these tasks, I effectively employed my graphic design acumen using a range of tools such as Adobe Creative Suite, Design Space, Canva, and Procreate. Additionally, I demonstrated my proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite, with a primary focus on Excel for data management, Teams for collaboration, and PowerPoint for presentation creation.
