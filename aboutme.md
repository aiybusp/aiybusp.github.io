I am dedicated to making a change in the world, both big and small. I have a strong passion for what I do and am motivated by my family.  I take pride in my work and myself, always putting 110% in. I believe that with kindness and respect you can make someoneâ€™s day a little brighter. 

I am currently working as a Certified Pharmacy Technician as I simultaneously go to school for medical assisting with the intention of pursuing a higher education in the medical field. Im currently attending Pasadena City College as well in progress of earning my Bachelors in Science.
