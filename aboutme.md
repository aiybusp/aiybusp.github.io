I am dedicated to making a change in the world, both big and small, motivated by family. I take pride in my work and myself, always putting 110% in. I believe that with kindness and respect you can make someone’s day a little brighter. 

I am currently a honors student at Pasadena City College entering my sophomore year, as well as a current intern at NASA. I’m majoring in Biology with the intent to go into Laboratory Science with a specialty in microbiology and immunology.
