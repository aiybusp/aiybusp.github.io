Hi! Im Ari, a dedicated and driven future nurse with a strong foundation in patient care, medical terminology, and leadership. Im currently pursuing my Associate Degree in Nursing through Pasadena City College and have recently graduated top of my class in Medical Assisting, earning my Certified Clinical Medical Assistant (CCMA) credential. 

I currently hold two national pharmacy licenses and the California Pharmacy Technician license. Through my clinical training, coursework, and career, I've developed a deep appreciation for both the clinical and administrative sides of the board.

I am passionate about making healthcare more empathetic, accessible, and effective for everyone. I am motivated by making a change and helping others. My patients are my favorite part of the job, whether or not they know I am helping. Being on the receiving side of healthcare, I can understand how impactful the small things are. 

Outside of academics, I enjoy the outdoors and going on adventures with my friends and husband, with the beach being my favorite. I'm excited to grow in environments where I can bring both heart and skill to the team.
